# What I Learned Today in TypeScript

- How to use **namespaces** to organize code and group related types and classes.
- How **unique symbols** work as special, unique type markers for branding types.
- How to compile a TypeScript project with namespaces using `tsc` and the right `tsconfig.json` settings.
- Understanding the difference between namespaces and modules.
- Practicing creating interfaces, classes, and extending interfaces using declaration merging.

This helped me get a clearer picture of TypeScriptâ€™s type system and code organization.
